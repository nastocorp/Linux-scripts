**Title: user_management.sh**

his Bash script is designed for managing user accounts on a Linux system. It reads user information from a CSV file and performs user-related tasks based on the provided data. The script can add new users with hashed passwords or remove existing users, all based on the specified operations in the CSV file. It checks for the existence of users, creates or removes them as needed, and logs these actions to a log file for tracking purposes. This script automates user management tasks, making it easier to handle multiple users efficiently.
